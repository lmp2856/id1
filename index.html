            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <!--- Question 1: Tell me about your path to becoming a designer. How did you get where you are today? --->
            <p>When I first started college, I really had no idea what I wanted to major in. I went from theater to psychology, and even contemplated zoology. Finally, I realized I could obtain a degree combining two interests and hobbies I enjoyed: art and technology.</p>
            <p>When I first started graphic design, I wasn't sure how well I would be at using various computer programs to create artwork. Once I began my first graphics class, I realized I had a knack for this line of work. I fell in love with designing and it has become an enjoyable line of work for me.</p>
            <!--- Question 2: Tell me about your aspirations as a designer. What do you hope to do with design? --->
            <p>After graduating with my Associate's in Graphic Design, I hope to either continue school and obtain a bachelor's degree or obtain a job designing websites. I want to use my newly found coding skills and graphic design skills to create websites and advertisements for organziations with a cause. I want to educate the masses and reach out to people via the internet. I want to promote various social causes such as animal rights, women's rights, and enviromental preservation.
