<p><b><i>Below, describe your process creating your wireframe. How did the content of your essay inform the hierarchy of your wireframe?</i></b><br>
When creating my wireframe, I knew I wanted to stick to a simple blog-styled layout. Since I had a heavy content essay, I knew I wanted to use a divider to help break up the essay. This is shown in my wire frame through line breaks. I mapped out where I needed to put each image, and where to create a visual break from the text.

<p><b><i>Below, describe your process creating your moodboards. In the next project, what would you do differently?</i></b><br>
I knew how I wanted my website to look, so I used visual cues, such as the drawings, on my moodboard to indiciate the theme I was going for. I also used similar colors and various adjectives to describe the look and feel of my site. Next time, I will definitely explore more options and create more than one moodboard. I will also be more detailed and spend more time creating a distinct direction with my next set of moodboards.

<p><b><i>Below, describe your process of translating your wireframe & moodboards into HTML + CSS. What did you find easy & straightforward? What did you find frustrating?</i></b><br>
The easiest part of creating the design throuhgh coding was definitely the HTML. HTML is pretty straight forward and is just the bare bones of the design. Setting up the order and structure of the code was very easy. The hardest part of the process was definitely the CSS. Not everything lined up correctly and the hardest part was individually changing the code for each item. One set off CSS code worked on one image, while another image had to be tweaked. It is very frustrating and time consuming.
</p>
<p><b><i>Finally, list any takeaways from Project 1. For future HTML & CSS projects, what would you do differently? What would you keep the same?</i></b><br>
I will definitely be more aware of the order and organization of my code, especially my CSS. Setting up an order for each set is definitely useful and more efficient.
