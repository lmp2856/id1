<h4>What Is Factory Farming?</h4>
<p>In the United States, over 99% of farm animals are raised in factory farms. A factory farm is a large industrialized farm in which large numbers of livestock are raised indoors in conditions intended to maximize production at minimal cost.  The conditions used in order to maximize effienceny are inhumane and are always at the expense of the animals&apos; welfare. Not only does it effect the animals that are exploited, it also greatly effects the earth&apos;s natural resources, which in return, effects us.</p>
