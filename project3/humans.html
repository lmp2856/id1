    <header><h4>How Does Factory Farming Effect Humans?</h4></header>
<ul>
    <li><p>Factory farming not only puts animals&apos; well-being at risk, but ours as well. Not only are the environmental effects of factory farming a huge risk for the human population, but the very products we ingest have a negative impact on our health. Factory farmed meats and dairy put the human population at risk for various chronic diseases, obesity, and drug resistant bacteria, due to the unnatural feeds, hormones, and excessive antibiotics given to the animals we ingest for food.</p></li>
    <li><p>One big problem, especially in America, is the amount and quality of saturated fat in our diet. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,the primary source of saturated fat in the American diet comes from animal products. Heart disease and obesity are directly linked to saturated fat. The practices used in factory farms, such as using unnatural feed and the use of growth hormones, has lead to a high saturated fat content in meat. Not only is there a high saturated fat increase, but the various growth hormones used in the American dairy industry, which directly link to the beef industry because dairy cows are eventually slaughtered for meat, have been shown to increase the risk of breast, prostate, and colon cancer in beef-eating consumers. None of this information regarding the use of hormones is required by law to be placed on product labels for consumers to evaluate.</p></li>
    <li><p>Antibiotics re given to factory farmed animals to promote rapid growth. In the United States. 70% of all antibiotics used in the country are given to factory farmed animals for non-therapeutic purposes. This over-use of antibiotics helps create drug-resistant bacteria. This results in certain bacterial infections becoming untreatable in humans. Every year in America, 90,000 citizens die due to antibiotic resistant infections.</p></li>
    <li><p>Because of poor sanitation and waste management on factory farms, the very food we eat can easily become contaminated due to the conditions the animals we eat are placed in. E.coli and salmonella are bacteria that pose a huge risk for illness and can easily contaminate the products we buy and eat. Every year, 76 million U.S. citizens come sick from food borne illnesses, and in thousands of cases, even die from such contamination.</p></li>
    <li><p>There are even cases of &ldquo;zootonic&rdquo; diseases that can become pandemics. The swine flu outbreak, or H1N1, was believed to be caused by the overcrowding of pigs on factory farmed and the poor storage of their waste in manure lagoons.</p></li>
