<p id="intro">Billions of animals are exploited and subjected to horrific conditions, in order to produce various products for human consumption. The lives they endure include the following:</p>
<header>Animals Used For Meat:</header>
    <header>Pigs</header>
    <section id="pigs-meat">
    <img src="images/Pig-Meat.png" alt="images of pigs in meat industry" id="pigsmeat">
    <ul>
        <li><p>Sows, female pigs, are first impregnated at only 7 months of age.</p></li>
        <li><p>They spend the majority of their lives confined to a gestation crate.</p></li>
        <li><p>A gestation crate is only slightly larger than the size of the sow&apos;s body, which essentially restricts their movements and even their ability to lay down comfortably.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sows are exposed to high levels of ammonia, resulting in respiratory disease, from being directly exposed to their own feces at all times due to the poor design of gestation crates.</p></li>
        <li><p>Not only do sows suffer physical damage from unnatural settings, they also suffer psychological damage.</p></li>
        <li><p>Confined sows are known to exhibit abnormal behaviors, such as biting at the bars of crates, which cause sores and mouth damage.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sows are moved to farrowing crates for nursing, after their piglets are born.</p></li>
        <li><p>These crates separate the mother from the piglets and restrict her movements just as much as the gestation crates.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sows are placed back into gestation crates once their piglets are weaned, and are then re-impregnated.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once a sow is deemed &ldquo;spent&rdquo;, after producing over 2-2.5 litters a year over the span of several years, they are then sent to the slaughterhouse.</p></li>
        <li><p>When piglets are around 20 days old, they endure bodily mutlitations without the use of any anesthetic for pain.</p></li>
        <li><p>They are castrated and also have portions of their tails removed.</p></li>
        <li><p>For the next 6 months, the piglets spend their lives in overcrowded pens until they reach the correct &ldquo;market weight&rdquo;, then they are sent to be slaughtered.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </section>
    <header>Cows</header>
    <img src="images/cow-meat.png" alt="images of cows in meat industry" id="cowsmeat">
    <ul>
        <li><p>Once calves are separated from their mothers, they endure mutilations without any type of pain relief.</p></li>
        <li><p>These include dehorning, castration, and even branding.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cattle are moved from pasture to feedlots to reach their &ldquo;market weight&rdquo; between the age of 6 months to a year.</p></li>
        <li><p>Since feedlots are in only four U.S. states, calves endure grueling cross-country trips in which they are often denied food, water, or protection from the elements.</p></li>
        <li><p>Calves gain weight on an unnatural diet where they reach 1,200 pounds in just 6 months.</p></li>
        <li><p>Since feedlots are in only four U.S. states, calves endure grueling cross-country trips in which they are often denied food, water, or protection from the elements.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once they reach &ldquo;market weight&rdquo;, the cattle are then sent to the slaughterhouse.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <header>Chickens</header>
    <img src="images/chicken-meat.png" alt="images of chickens in meat industry" id="chickensmeat">
    <ul>
        <li><p>Chickens typically spend their lives confined to warehouse-like buildings, known as broilers, which can hold as many as 20,000 chickens.</p></li>
        <li><p>The average space per chicken is only slightly larger than a sheet of letter-size paper.</p></li>
        <li><p>This overcrowding results in scratches and sores from the birds being forced to walk all over each other.</p></li>
        <li><p>Floors in these buildings are covered in the waste of tens of thousands of chickens, which causes health problems for the chickens, including difficulty breathing.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lights in the building are constantly kept on, in order to stimulate eating which cause unnatural rapid growth,  leading to serious health problems.</p></li>
        <li><p>Approximately 30% of broiler chickens suffer skeletal deformities, as a result of their unnatural growth, which result in difficulty walking or supporting their own body weight.</p></li>
        <li><p>They can also suffer acute heart failure from improper oxygen circulation due to the taxing effect of  unnatural growth on their hearts and lungs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Although their bodies have been swollen beyond the size of an average adult chicken, broiler chickens are typically are sent to slaughter at around 42 days old.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <header>Animals Used For Eggs and Dairy Products:</header>
    <header>Chickens</header>
    <img src="images/chicken-dairy.png" alt="images of chickens in egg industry" id="chickenegg">
    <ul>
        <li><p>Hundreds of millions of male chicks are killed each year right after hatching because they are unable to produce eggs.</p></li>
        <li><p>These methods include being sucked up into a series of pipes where they are then either electrocuted on a &ldquo;kill plate&rdquo;, ground up alive in a &ldquo;macerator&rdquo;, or gassed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Female chicks are subjected to debeaking, which consists of their beaks being cut or seared off, in order to prevent feather-pecking, which is a direct result of the stressful environment they are placed in.</p></li>
        <li><p>95% of hens are kept in battery cages, which hold 5-10 birds.</p></li>
        <li><p>Hens suffer severe feather loss, bruises, and abrasion from constantly rubbing against each other and standing on wire cages.</p></li>
        <li><p>Hens will produce more than 250 eggs a year, compared to only 15 eggs a year when in nature.</p></li>
        <li><p>In order to achieve this high production of eggs, hens are sometimes starved for up to two weeks in order to induce another egg-laying cycle.</p></li>
        <li><p>Industry chickens may live 5-8 years, but if considered &ldquo;spent&rdquo;, after egg production declines, they are sent to the slaughterhouse, sometimes after only a year or two of living.</p></li>
        <li><p>&ldquo;Spent&rdquo; hens are often killed through the process of gassing  with high concentrations of carbon dioxide.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <header>Cows</header>
    <img src="images/cow-dairy.png" alt="images of cows in dairy industry" id="cowsdairy">
    <ul>
        <li><p>Dairy cows&apos; lives consist of a constant cycle of impregnation, birth, and milking, with very little rest in between.</p></li>
        <li><p>Calves are taken away from their mothers within just a few hours after birth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Male calves, unable to produce milk, are either sent to be raised for beef or raised for veal.</p></li>
        <li><p>The average dairy cow is forced to produce more than 20,000 lbs of milk.</p></li>
        <li><p>The majority of dairy cows spend their lives indoors, on concrete floors, often connected to a milking apparatus.</p></li>
        <li><p>These cows often suffer from damage to the udders by milking machines, as well as high levels of mastitis, which results in a very painful swelling of the glands of the udder.</p></li>
        <li><p>Some dairy cows are repeatedly injected genetically-engineered hormones, such as bovine, which is proven to increase the risk of health problems, such as mastitis.</p></li>
        <li><p>Dairy cows also are subject to &ldquo;tail docking&rdquo;, which is the cutting off of their tails.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once dairy cows are considered &ldquo;spent&rdquo;, usually after less than 5 years of age, they are sent to the slaughterhouse.</p></li>
