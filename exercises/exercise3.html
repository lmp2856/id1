            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The article&apos;s main title, &quot;Mind Control&quot;, is a piece of artwork in itself The mosaic feel of the colors and contrasts used to make the title feel very artsy, and I think fit well for this particular artist. Not only does the completed title look great, but when scrolling down the page, the title deconstructs and reveals the full image of the artist behind. Each header and significant quote is shown in a italics and is encased in a diamond graphic. This allows the header and/or quote to really stand out, and it shows the significance of the content. The fonts used in this article are elegant, which represent the artist very accurately.</p>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palate is soft. There are a lot of creams and elegant colors. At the beginning and the end of the article, the colors fade out and the images are turned black and white. This is very representative of the artist, because it visually represents the color and life that she brings with her music.</p>
            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals are very well done. Each photo used of the artist is beautifully done. The diamond shapes that encase each header provide a significant break from the lengthy article. Each main section of the article has a different photo used. Each photo used, corresponds accurately with what the content of the article is about.</p>
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>Sections are separated by different layout formats and various images. The text is sometimes flipped from the right side to the left side. The photographs change which each new section. The diamond shaped headers break up the article as well.</p>
