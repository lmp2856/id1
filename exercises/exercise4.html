        <h1>Daft Punk Website Analysis</h1>
        <ol>
            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The beginning sentence of each main section&apos;s first paragraph is bold, in all caps, and is a separate font from the rest of the section. This helps identify the start of each significant section . The main headers&apos; font have a very interesting animation to them The leaders sporadically change to numbers, incorporating the tech language of 0&apos;s and 1&apos;s. This represents the artists very well, and play into their scifi appeal.</p>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palate consists of mostly orange and blue. This is a great complimentary contrast, and flow well with the images that are provided. The body text consistently stays black and it also matches the color scheme and images.</p>
            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The images and gifs used on this article are done very well. The main title is placed upon an image of the two artists standing behind flames. It helps present the artists as larger than life, with almost a movie scene feel to it. The still images are very high contrast and clean, which make the images appear very comic book like. All of this really represent who Daft Punk is. They are very much &quot;out of this world.&quot;</p>
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>Sections are separate with various elements. Large images that cover the whole window size separate some sections, as well as background image changes. At some point, the animated headers are shown as well as an animated background image.</p>
