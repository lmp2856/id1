        <h1>Majical Cloudz Website Analysis</h1>
        <ol>
            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The article's title font is very large. It directly pulls into the viewer and is evident that it is the main title of the site. The first letter of the article's body is very large, however it works because the designer positioned it in a way that it seamlessly blends into the paragraph. Each pull quote's font is as large as the main title. This worked because the quotes are very unique and intriguing. The large font forces the user to read each quote, which then leads into each section.</p>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palette is soft, and directly pulled from the photos used on the site. Therefore, the correlation of colors and images works perfectly. The colors mostly used are a deep plum, off-white, and black. The designer used contrast very well on the first photo used in the beginning of the website. The title of the article is dark against a lighter background, which causes it to stand out. The credits are made white, which are visible but do not overshadow the title.</p>
            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals are used to break up the overall content of the site. There is a gif or image separating the content into sections. There is also a pattern amongst the visuals. The website starts off with a large image and ends with one as well. Each visual reinforces the actual people involved in the band, giving the article as more personal feel. Not only are the images and gifs used to indicate sections, the overall feel of the images themselves are eery, which represent the band's music quite well.</p>
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>Sections are separated with images and large, blocked quotes. Although they are used to break up the content, the larger images that reach the width of the window actually separate the content into larger sections base on the content. For instance, after the introduction a larger image is used to separate the introduction and the first section that describes the technical aspects of their band's music.</p>
