                    <li><strong>What adjectives would you use to describe Bethany’s portfolio?</strong>
                        <p>Neat, clean, simple</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Describe the design of the navigation. What pages are on Bethany’s portfolio?</strong>
                        <p>The navigation on the About Me page is simple. It consists of three elements located in the upper right hand corner: About, Work, Muses.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Describe the design of the introductory information. What have you learned about Bethany?</strong>
                        <p>She grabs the viewer with a very large, and witty, header. She follows up the header with a pull quote of her own that also displays a large font size. In her own pullquote she describes her college education from Auburn University and her work that has been featured in various big name magazines.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Describe the design & layout of the body content.</strong>
                        <p>The body content is shown in three columns. The text based content is separated with two headers. The body content is on the small sifde; a vast contrast to the extra large introductory information. She also includes an email contact box and a downloadable copy of her resume.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Describe the design of the footer. What information does Bethany include here?</strong>
                        <p>The footer consists of various icons representing different links that include her social media links, a link to another designer, and a copyright stamp. All three groups are neatly separated and organized.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <li><strong>How does the navigation change?</strong>
                    <p>The three navigation links (About Me, Work, and Muses) have now been hidden but are now accessible by a navigation bar. When you click on the navigation bar icon (the three bars) in the upper right corner, the three links will appear.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>How does the size of the headline text change?</strong>
                    <p>The headline text has been scaled down dramatically, however, it is still larger than the body text and still shows a contrast.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>How does the size of the body text change?</strong>
                    <p>The body text seems to be the same as far as font size and style. Instead of being in three columns, the text is now listed as one column, but it still separated by headers.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>How does the layout of the content change?</strong>
                    <p>The layout of the content is now single column instead of three column.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>How does the layout of the footer change?</strong>
                        <p>Instead of the three groups being separated across a single line, they are now stacked on top of each, but are still distinguishingbly separated.</p></li>

                <li><strong>Describe the layout of the website.</strong>
                <p>The layout of this portfolio is very simple and minimalistic. All of the text is aligned left. There are three columns. The first lists his descripton, information, and contact links. The second lists all of his project titles. The third seems to be a side project. The links to the projects do change the colors of the background and do show a small logo and description of each project.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Describe the design of website. How does Danilo indicate hierarchy?</strong>
                    <p>There is no clear distinguishable hierarchy. All of the text is the same style and size. The only indication of separating content is the three column style.</p></li>
