        <h1>The state of the world</h1>
        <p>I love the nature of the world. The plants, animals, many landscapes, and colors are wonderous and glorious. Nothing man-made compares to the beauty of nature.</p>
        <p>I hate how industrialized everything has become. The man-made structures and "concrete cages" that have become standard sight are slowly killing the earth and mankind itself. The state of disillusion the modern society has created is horrifying, and I fear for the future of our world.</p>
        <p>I wish humans would be kinder to one another. I wish they would stray away from greed and corruption. If everyone cared about their environment and the well-being of all humans and creatures, the world would be the utopia that we all dream of.</p>
